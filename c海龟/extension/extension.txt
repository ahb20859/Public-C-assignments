The current four test files(simp.ttl, simp_c.ttl, spiral1_c.ttl, spiral2_c.ttl) are all drawn continuously, which means that when I want to draw down, the subsequent graphics and the previous ones are connected together. If I want to draw multiple independent graphics continuously, they should not be connected together, which is impossible. In this extension, I add a command, which can control the brush to lift and move to the specified position without drawing lines, so as to complete the drawing of multiple independent graphics. Reference resources extension.ttl The MOVE command of the file. The file is also combined with spiral2_ c.ttl files and simp.ttl File instructions to complete the four (of course, you can specify any) regular octagons drawing.

I implemented the interpreter of the move instruction in the extension module, and successfully drew several independent regular octagons.
